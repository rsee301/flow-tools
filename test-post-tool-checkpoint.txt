This is a test file to verify that post-tool checkpoints are working correctly.

The system should create a checkpoint after this Write operation if:
1. Enough time has passed since the last checkpoint (5 minutes by default)
2. There are enough changes (3 files minimum by default)

This helps ensure continuous backup without excessive commits.
