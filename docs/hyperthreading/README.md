# Claude Flow Hyperthreading Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for implementing hyperthreaded development using Claude Flow with Git worktrees. This approach enables parallel development of complex features with shared intelligence and coordination.

## Documents

### 1. [Git Worktree Integration](./git-worktree-claude-flow-integration.md)
Comprehensive analysis and design document covering:
- Technical feasibility (8.5/10 score)
- Architecture design and components
- Memory sharing strategies
- Coordination patterns
- Implementation roadmap
- Performance considerations

### 2. [Implementation Guide](./implementation-guide.md)
Step-by-step practical implementation:
- Quick start setup
- Worktree configuration
- Coordination service setup
- CLI command extensions
- Monitoring and debugging
- Docker deployment

### 3. [AstroWrangler Case Study](./astrowrangler-case-study.md)
Real-world example implementing Orekit and GMAT in parallel:
- Project timeline and progress
- Actual code examples
- Performance metrics (50% time reduction)
- Challenges and solutions
- Lessons learned

## Key Benefits

- **70-80% disk space savings** vs multiple clones
- **50% development time reduction** for parallel features
- **Shared swarm intelligence** across branches
- **Natural Git workflow** integration
- **Improved code quality** through continuous cross-validation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install hyperthreading support
npm install -g claude-flow-hyperthread

# Initialize project
npx claude-flow-hyperthread init --project=your-project

# Create feature worktrees
git worktree add ../project-feature1 feature/feature1
git worktree add ../project-feature2 feature/feature2

# Launch parallel development
npx claude-flow-hyperthread launch \
  --objective="Your development objective" \
  --worktrees="feature1,feature2" \
  --parallel
```

## Architecture Overview

```
Main Repository (.git/)
├── claude-flow-shared/     # Shared memory & coordination
├── worktrees/
│   ├── feature1/          # Isolated development
│   └── feature2/          # Isolated development
└── hooks/                 # Worktree-aware hooks

Coordination Layer
├── Registry Service       # Track active worktrees
├── Memory Sync Manager    # Cross-worktree memory
├── Message Bus           # Agent communication
└── Conflict Resolver     # Handle merge conflicts
```

## Use Cases

1. **Parallel Feature Development**: Implement multiple features simultaneously
2. **Library Integration**: Integrate multiple external libraries in parallel
3. **Platform Porting**: Port to multiple platforms concurrently
4. **API Versioning**: Develop multiple API versions in parallel
5. **Experimental Features**: Isolate experiments while sharing learnings

## Requirements

- Git 2.5+ (worktree support)
- Node.js 18+
- Claude Flow v2.0.0+
- SQLite3
- Unix-like OS (for coordination sockets)
